    - more diverse and interesting enemies
    - more diverse and interesting loot
    - leveling system! (WIP)
    - quests!
    - dungeons!
    - life commands, such as /farm, /beg (for the memes), /hunt, /cook (maybe), /mine, /fish and others
    - more items, such as weapons, armor, food, potions, etc.
    - more monsters! and bosses!

    - crafting system! (maybe)
    - drop command so you can remove an item of your choice from your inventory
    - work system (might be added another time)
    - more interactive commands, such as /duel


LEVELING SYSTEM (WIP)

idea: in this RPG, the leveling system will be a bit different in terms of how you use the experience to level up

    experience will have a maxxp per level, each level it will be increasing
    you gain experience the usual way, /fight, /boss, /duel and some lifeskills
    when your xp reaches the maxxp, you will have to use /levelup to level up
    at each levelup, there will be a chance to fail leveling up, reseting your xp to 0
    as you level up, it will get harder to succeed leveling up, and easier to fail, ofc there will be some bypass items to help increase the chance
    each levelup will increase maxhealth (also healing your character up), attack, defense and some other stats depending on your class
    each levelup will also increase your maxxp, making it harder to level up


COMBAT SYSTEM V2.0 (WIP)

idea: the combat system right now is a bit plain, so I will add the following features

    dodge chance : every time your enemy will try to hit you, there will be a chance to dodge the attack. The chance will increase based on agility
    critical hit chance : every time you will try to hit your enemy, there will be a chance to deal double damage. 
    The chance will increase based on luck and the multiplier based on intelligence
    damage reduction : every time you will get hit, there will be a chance to reduce the damage taken. The chance will increase based on defense

This will be all currently, more will be likely to be added at another time


CLASS SELECTION V2.0 (WIP)

idea: the class selection right now is very simple and plain, with only 3 classes to choose from and there is not enough diversity

    5 new classes will be added, each with their own unique abilities
        - warrior : the warrior is a class that is mostly balanced in every aspect
        - mage : the mage is a high damage class with low survivability, a very high intelligence means high damage output during fights
        - archer : the archer is a class that has high damage and agility, but lacks in defense. Has moderate health
        - assassin : the assassin is a class that has an even higher agility than the archer but lacks in luck, defense and health
        - paladin : the paladin is a class that has high defense and health, but lacks in agility and luck. Has moderate damage output

    Class special abilities:
        - warrior : the lower the health, the bigger the damage
        - mage : lowers the enemies defense
        - archer : chance to attack twice
        - assassin : chance to backstab the enemy, dealing double the crit damage
        - paladin : chance to heal himself each round for a small amount

    Class stats:

        WARRIOR: 
            - health : 125
            - attack : 10
            - defense : 10

            - luck : 5
            - intelligence : 5

ENEMIES V2.0 (WIP)

idea: each zone needs to have a pretty good number of monsters to promote diversity and make the game more interesting

    5 new monsters will be added, each with their own unique abilities
        - zombie : a zombie is a monster that has low health and damage, but has a chance to infect you, dealing damage over time
        - skeleton : a skeleton is a monster that has moderate health and damage, but has a chance to paralyze you, making you unable to attack
        - spider : a spider is a monster that has low health and damage, but has a chance to poison you, dealing damage over time
        - slime : a slime is a monster that has low health and damage, but has a chance to blind you, making you unable to dodge
        - ghost : a ghost is a monster that has low health and damage, but has a chance to curse you, making you unable to crit


ZONES V2.0 (WIP)

idea: right now there is only one zone which is quite sad, so let's make more of those and also make them look more warm and welcoming, or completely the opposite!

    zone 1 : The young forest
        - a forest that is still young, with a lot of trees and animals
        - monsters : slimes, spiders, (thinking)
        - the boss here is a giant spider
    
    zone 2 : The deep forest
        - a deep dark forest roamed only by ferocious animals
        - monsters : wolves, bears, (thinking)
        - the boss here is the Wolfpack Leader

    zone 3 : The Adventurer's road
        - the road that leads to the Town of Beginnings!
        - monsters : bandit archer, bandit thug, armored bandit, rogue, angry traveller, (thinking)
        - the boss here is the Bandit Leader
    
    zone 4 : Town of Beginnings
        - the town where everything starts! Fight good adventurers to grab the attention of the Adventurer's Guild leader!
        - monsters : adventurer, strong villager, 
        - the boss here is the Adventurer's Guild Leader

    More zones will be added at another time

PROFILE SYSTEM (WIP)

idea: /profile will replace /stats as it will give much more information to the user and also being more compact and better looking than using /stats + /balance + /inventory 
    /profile will replace all the above mentioned commands and will use a dropdown View to cycle through the different pages
