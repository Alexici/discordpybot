FEATURES

        The discord bot has a diverse set of features, including:

            - Moderation commands, all these commands require the user to have the specific permission in order to use them:

                Kick, Ban / Unban members with just a slash command, the output message by the bot is a ephemeral message, so only the user who used the command can see it.

                Clear messages in bulk, the bot will delete the messages in bulk, and will send a ephemeral message to the user who used the command.

                Warn members, made to be used mostly for fun since it doesn't have a warn list, currently doesn't need any special permissions and can be used by anyone.
                This command will be modified in the future to require a specific permission or to be able to be manualy enabled/disabled by the server owner or admins.

                Slowmode, this command will set the slowmode of the channel to the specified time, it will also send a ephemeral message to the user who used the command.

                Automated Welcome message! The bot will send a welcome message to the user who joined the server, the message can be customized by the server owner or admins.
            

            - Fun commands, all these commands don't require any special permissions to be used:

                8ball, this command will give you a random answer to your question, the answer is chosen randomly from a list of answers.

                Coinflip, this command will flip a coin and will give you the result. Heads or tails?

                Stonks, like memes but... stonks.
